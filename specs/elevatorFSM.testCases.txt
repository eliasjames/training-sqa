// Basic rules
from a waiting state, when a floor is called, elevator should move towards it
while moving, the elevator floor number should update
while moving, elevator should listen to calls and accept stops in same direction
as it passes each floor, elevator should check if it needs to stop
when there are no more stops, return to waiting state

// UX improvement
if it reaches the top or bottom floor, the elevator should check for unanswered calls in the opposite direction

// multiple elevators
while moving, elevator should listen to calls cancelled
